 *
 * While ESB owns the radio, clear the PPI channels the LL owns so no shortcut
 * can reach RADIO.  We deliberately do NOT mask TIMER0/RTC0 IRQs: the BT host
 * still expects to drive HCI commands (adv start/stop) while ESB is active —
 * wrapping them to no-op above keeps the host's view of the controller
 * consistent, but the controller's own TIMER/RTC ISRs must keep running so
 * pending commands can be acked, else the host thread blocks forever.
 *
 * Mask covers PPI channels 6-19 (programmable, used by LL via SW split ticker
 * and RADIO enable/disable/capture), plus fixed PPIs 22/23/25 (HCTO disable,
 * AAR trigger, CRYPT trigger) — see radio_nrf5_ppi_resources.h.
